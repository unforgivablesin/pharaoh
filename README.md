An alpha version of the new Pharaoh package manager and sandbox manager. Fetches packages from the Arch Linux repositories and installs them in a sandboxed environment much like Flatpak. This will include extensive seccomp support in the future as well as more fine grained portal selection.
Pharaoh is being developed for a new upcoming Linux Distribution

**WARNING** it doesn't verify downloaded packages yet and only works on Arch Linux. **THIS IS ALPHA 0.1**
